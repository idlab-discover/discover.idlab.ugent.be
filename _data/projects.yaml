        ## PACSOI

        Enabling Solid for healthcare.

        Healthcare ecosystems are siloed and data sharing is minimal. With Solid, we enable data sharing between healthcare applications to better support patients.

        Partners:
        * FAQIR Institute & Foundation
        * AContrario, moveUP, Byteflies
        * IDLab - Ghent University - imec

        ## Diktyo

        Network-aware Kubernetes sheduling

        This project enables Kubernetes to take application topology and network topology into account when sheduling applications. This reduces the network latency of microservice applications running in Kubernetes.
        
        [See the code](https://github.com/diktyo-io).
